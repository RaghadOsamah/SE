# workshop02_group5_SoftwareEngineering2
This workshop is based on developing a web-based machine learning system for simple text classification. the application has an interface that takes text from user then classifiy it with the correct associated label. 
 
 we used html language to create interface, also javascript because of functionality. we used ubuntu operating system to run the code.

we faced many challenges, first the ubuntu was not able to download the files because of the size was too large. second the javascript and html languages was new languages we have no experience with it. third the travis ask us to select paied plan because we exceed the number of users.

if you want to run the project first you need to istall (train.txt, index.js, index.html) then write in terminal (node index.js). finally open the browser write in the search bar (localhost:8000) then write in text area any text then click submit.

we made many releases on the project because we wanted to add new functionalities, fix buges and add new features.
